# politicssucks
Office politics sucks and exists, even in silicon valley startups. This is why startups seek “startup savvy” employees.
Every startup employee, regardless of whether, they are a manager or an individual contributor endures “ office politics”. 

This is because decisions need to be made at all levels and they vividly remember the decision rationale and some utilize it to wield power, resources are limited and it takes finite time to fix scarcity, knowledge is nuanced and asymmetric and therefore a person or team tries to assert power, policies need to be based on the context, otherwise it appears silly and not followed by majority of employees.

Facilities:
a) VOIP Phones: There is only budget for 100 VOIP Phones. After that, the price skyrockets by almost four times. 15 new employees, joined 100 existing employees, including a manager and a seasoned individual contributor, both would be on customer calls everyday and both needs to be reachable at their desks. 25 existing employees are expected to leave, as their project/product got canned. 
Some questions:
What will management do? Will they articulate this situation to every employee?  or only spot the unhappy ones and explain to them? Will the manager get pissed, if that seasoned individual contributor be allocated a phone first, as he started attending tough customer calls, from day one? Who will articulate this situation to employees, the CIO/IT chief or any member of IT who happened to address the grievance of an employee?

2) Mail Slots:  There used be just 60 employees in the building. Now, there are more than 100 employees. The mailroom shelf cannot accommodate more than 100. The new manager is a member of several trade organizations and he periodically receives paper journals, invitations to conferences etc., How will you reconfigure the mail room, until the move, to a bigger place, which is planned in 2 quarters?

3) Cubicles: There is room only for 80 cubicles, in the current building.  When more employees joined, several cubes were joined together and “bull pens” were created and the new college grads. were housed there. But, now there are fairly experienced employees in the latest entrants.  Where will you house them and how will you make them productive, until the move?

4) Offices: Luckily, most good silicon valley startups don’t have offices, even for their CEOs. CEOs use conference rooms for having confidential conversations with customers. Otherwise, with the capacity problem, it would be a nightmare to kick people out of offices, to create conference rooms.

5) Conference Rooms: Most startups would use Outlook to schedule conference rooms. Otherwise, it would be impossible to deal with conflicts. Even with reservation systems, some members use conference rooms as their offices, virtually using the whole day, having charts and other things on the wall, to exert more dominance.

6) Dinner: A lot of startups provide dinner, for employees who stay beyond 6 pm.  There is no predictable pattern. Therefore, on some days a lot of food goes wasted. So, if the admin. orders less food, as a reaction, employees would start complaining.

7) Stationery: It seems some employees take their stationery to be given to their school-going kids. So, as a result, in some cases, the office supplies would be locked and the admin. holds the key.
